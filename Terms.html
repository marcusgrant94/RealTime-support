            <h2>ðŸ“œ RealTime â€“ Terms of Use & Community Guidelines</h2>
            <p>Last Updated: July 31, 2025</p>
        </section>

        <section class="terms-section">
            <h2>Welcome to RealTime ðŸ‘‹</h2>
            <p>
                RealTime was built to make digital connection feel a little more human â€” share the moment, connect in real time, and stay close to the people who matter. To keep things real (and safe), weâ€™ve created these Terms of Use and Community Guidelines to set the standard for behavior on our platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                By using RealTime, you agree to follow these rules. If you donâ€™t agree, please donâ€™t use the app. If you do â€” thanks for being part of a respectful, authentic community.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="terms-section">
            <h2>1. Who Can Use RealTime</h2>
            <p>To use RealTime, you must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Be 13 years or older</li>
                <li>Not use bots or automated tools to interact with the app</li>
                <li>Use your real identity â€” no impersonating people, brands, or celebrities</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="terms-section">
            <h2>2. Respect the Community (What Not to Post)</h2>
            <p>
                This app allows users to post photos, captions, and messages. Thatâ€™s called user-generated content (UGC) â€” and with that freedom comes responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>You may not post, send, or share content that includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hate speech, racism, or harassment of any kind</li>
                <li>Nudity or sexually explicit content</li>
                <li>Promotion of violence, self-harm, or illegal activity</li>
                <li>Spam, scams, misleading content, or fake accounts</li>
                <li>Anything that violates another personâ€™s privacy, safety, or rights</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="terms-section">
            <h2>3. Your Content, Your Responsibility</h2>
            <p>
                You own the content you post. But by using RealTime, you give us permission to display your content within the app â€” for your friends to see or wherever it was meant to be shared.
            </p>
            <p>
                RealTime does not claim ownership, but youâ€™re responsible for making sure:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You have the rights to the content</li>
                <li>It doesnâ€™t violate any laws or our rules</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to remove content or suspend accounts that violate these terms.
            </p>

        <section class="terms-section">
            <h2>4. Flagging & Moderation</h2>
            <p>
                See something that crosses the line? You can flag any post, story, or message using the Report button.
            </p>
            <p>
                We review flagged content promptly. Depending on the situation, we may:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove the content</li>
                <li>Warn or suspend the user</li>
                <li>Permanently ban repeat offenders</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Certain serious violations (e.g., hate speech, child exploitation, or threats) will result in immediate and permanent removal.
            </p>

        <section class="terms-section">
            <h2>5. Account Suspension & Removal</h2>
            <p>We may:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Temporarily suspend your account for violating the rules</li>
                <li>Permanently ban users with repeated or extreme violations</li>
                <li>Suspend accounts for abnormal behavior that threatens the security of the app or users</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You may appeal moderation decisions by contacting our support team.
            </p>
            <p>
